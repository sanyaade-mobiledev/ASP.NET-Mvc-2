- Added ImprovedDynamicValidator control that fixes issues with DynamicValidator
correctly catching exceptions thrown off a validated data model object. A tag mapping
in web.config is used to automatically replace all instance of DynamicValidator with
ImprovedDynamicValidator. This validator is also now added to the ForeignKey_Edit
template.

- Fixed a number of issues with the default Style.css stylesheet being to generic.
Also added the AjaxToolkitFixes.css stylesheet to work around certain issues with using
Ajax Control Toolkit controls embedded inside of field templates.

- Added EnumDataTypeAttribute that can be used to mark integral columns as actually
representing enumerated CLR types.

- Modified the Enumeration field template and filter template to take
EnumDataTypeAttribute into account.

- Modified the Enumeration filter template to detect if an enum is in flags mode
and display a CheckBoxList instead of a DropDownList.

- Added validation to the DbImage_Edit template. It now verifies that the provided file
is a valid image and also that a file is provided at all if the column is required.

- Added constraints to routes to illustrate how to block invalid requests.
