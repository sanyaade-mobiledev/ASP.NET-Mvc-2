Dynamic Data Futures 1.1 Changes
--------------------------------

- Renamed project to Dynamic Data Futures.

- Moved/renamed a number of library files for better logical organization. Classes
are now organized what they generally do instead of how they apply to a particular
sample.

- Updated DbImage.ascx to better handle compound and GUID primary key tables. Also,
page templates will disable AJAX partial rendering when editing an image column to
allow the FileUpload control to work properly.

- Added support for complex where parameters. This can be seen in the pages under
ComplexWhereParameters in the sample app that already have a Where clause for
LinqDataSource but also use the filters to contribute extra components.

- Added automatic support for enumerated type columns. UIHint is no longer needed
to reference Enumeration.ascx.

- Moved a number of extension/utility methods to the DynamicDataFutures class. This
includes localization helpers, metadata helpers, and default value helpers.

- Consolidated IAutoFieldGenerator implementations into a single AdvancedFieldGenerator
class. It now includes functionality enabling column ordering, programatically
excluding a list of columns, and a workaround for issues with attribute localization.

- Refactored common LINQ Expression generation code into the LinqExpressionHelper
class.
