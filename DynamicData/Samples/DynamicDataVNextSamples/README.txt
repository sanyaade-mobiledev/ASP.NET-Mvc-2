This solution contains a number of samples showcasing new Dynamic Data and
data-bound control features that are being planned or considered for the next
version of ASP.NET. The samples include:

-	SampleProject – a sample project based on the upcoming new project templates.
It includes powerful Filters, Entity Templates, improved CSS, and illustrates how
to use Entity Framework and LINQ to SQL models side-by-side in a single Dynamic
Data application.

-	DataSourceSample – a showcase for a new DomainDataSource that combines
customizability of ObjectDataSource with the flexibility of LINQ and the IQueryable
interface. Also, a new Query block feature allowing high-level query composition in
markup is demonstrated.

-	DataServicesServer and DataServicesClient - illustrates the use of ADO.NET
Data Services with Dynamic Data. NOTE: the DataServicesServer project must be
running before DataServicesClient.

To run: load the solution in Visual Studio 2008 and launch any of the include
samples web sites.

Prerequisites: Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1
