The ASP.NET Dynamic Data 4.0 Preview 3 contains a number of different projects:

DynamicDataVNextSamples - This contains a variety of samples that show off the
various new aspects of Dyamic Data Preview 3

      -	SampleProject – a sample project based on the upcoming new project templates.
It includes powerful Filters, Entity Templates, improved CSS, and illustrates how
to use Entity Framework and LINQ to SQL models side-by-side in a single Dynamic
Data application.

      -	DataSourceSample – a showcase for a new DomainDataSource that combines
customizability of ObjectDataSource with the flexibility of LINQ and the IQueryable
interface. Also, a new Query block feature allowing high-level query composition in
markup is demonstrated.

      -	DataServicesServer and DataServicesClient - illustrates the use of ADO.NET
Data Services with Dynamic Data. NOTE: the DataServicesServer project must be
running before DataServicesClient.

DefaultDomainServiceProject - a starter project for building Dynamic Data projects
that use the DomainDataSource and .NET RIA Services for data access. This allows
programming against a rich business logic layer that is easily customized. We recommend
that you download the Microsoft .NET RIA Services March 09 Preview for having
wizards for creating DomainServices:
